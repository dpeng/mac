1. lots of programmer worried that the escape key will be urgly after the touch bar added, but it is dont, even more comfortable to use it. at least in my POV.
2. the touch bar is very easy to use and you will feel sad after it replace the F1 to F12
3. the keyboard is very comfortbal to use, before mac book, i use the mircosoft designer keyboard and mouse, i can adapt it easily
